# Obsidian Quick Tagger

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that adds commands and a GUI for selecting tags to add to the active note's frontmatter.

Originally developed to solve a personal workflow case, it's mostly intended for use on mobile and in conjunction with [Obsidian Commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander). 



## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.
